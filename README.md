# Self-Organising-Map-for-Air-Quality-index-Dat
Here we apply a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to analyze and visualize air quality data. The dataset consists of hourly measurements of various air pollutants and environmental factors such as CO, NOx, Benzene, Temperature, and Humidity. The SOM helps to identify patterns and clusters in the air quality data, allowing for better insights into pollutant levels over time.

To run this in Google Colab, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

->Google Colab environment (for execution)
->MiniSom (for implementing the Self-Organizing Map)
->NumPy and Pandas (for data manipulation)
->Matplotlib (for visualization)

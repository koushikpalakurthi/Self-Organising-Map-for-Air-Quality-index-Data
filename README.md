# Self-Organising-Map-for-Air-Quality-index-Data
Here we apply a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to analyze and visualize air quality data. The dataset consists of hourly measurements of various air pollutants and environmental factors such as CO, NOx, Benzene, Temperature, and Humidity. The SOM helps to identify patterns and clusters in the air quality data, allowing for better insights into pollutant levels over time.

To run this in Google Colab, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

->Google Colab environment (for execution)

->MiniSom (for implementing the Self-Organizing Map)

->NumPy and Pandas (for data manipulation)

->Matplotlib (for visualization)

**Execution Steps**

Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository
First, clone the repository or download the project files to your local environment or Colab workspace.

Step 2: Load the Dataset
Upload the AirQuality.csv dataset to Google Colab. You can use the following command to upload the file:

Step 3: Train and Visualize the SOM
Run the script cells in Colab sequentially.
The output will display the SOM visualization (U-Matrix) along with the data point markers.
Make sure the Python script contains the following sections for:

Loading and preprocessing the dataset,
Training the SOM,
Visualizing the SOM with a custom color palette.

Step 5: Interpret the Results
Once the execution is complete, analyze the U-Matrix visualization to identify clusters or patterns in the dataset.
